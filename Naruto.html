        <h3>Naruto's abilities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Shadow Clone Technique</strong>-This is Naruto's first
            trademark technique.He could use this technique, as well as its
            advanced version, to create hundreds of shadow clones and retain a
            decent amount of chakra in each one with relative ease. He could use
            them to outnumber or deceive his enemies in combat, maneuver himself
            in mid-air, transform into weapons, scout an area, or test an
            opponent's abilities.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Rasengan</strong>-Naruto's second trademark technique was
            the Rasengan, a one-handed technique created by his father. Due to
            his poor chakra control, Naruto often used a shadow clone to form
            the spherical shape while he provided the chakra. Over time,
            Naruto's improved skill allows him to produce larger versions of the
            Rasengan, perform it faster, and even have his shadow clones make
            their own Rasengan.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Massive Rasengan</strong>-It uses the same concept of
            compressing spinning chakra in one's palm as in the original
            Rasengan, only increasing the amount of chakra involved. Because
            there is even more chakra being compressed to a higher density, the
            ball releases its energy immediately on contact, thus increasing its
            destructive power beyond the Rasengan's.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>Wind Release: Rasenshuriken</strong>-The Rasenshuriken was
            invented by Naruto Uzumaki shortly after he figured out the
            principles of the Wind Release: Rasengan. Like that technique,
            Naruto typically has the help of two shadow clones in the
            Rasenshuriken's formation: he provides the chakra, one clone helps
            keep the chakra contained, and the second clone adds his wind
            nature. It is the completed version of the Wind Release: Rasengan,
            with four large points around the central Rasengan core, giving the
            appearance of a fÅ«ma shuriken.By the time of The Last: Naruto the
            Movie, Naruto is able to create Rasenshuriken without aid and is
            able to remotely guide it.
